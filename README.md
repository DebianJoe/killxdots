killxdots
=========

Dotfiles specific to my killx install.

Also, some scripts I use with it or RSI.
This includes the kxt (killxtoolkit) script that I maintain git repos with.
There is so much potential breakage and remote damage that I don't recommend using this at all unless you're 100% confident that you know exactly what you're doing.  If you push personal hacks upstream, it's not my fault when you get yelled at.


The expectation is that it will possibly work on bare minimum installs, but no promises are made.  Use at your own risk.

I am NOT responsible for accidents, maintaining, or any liability for damage to systems or files. (Check the license in code comments.)
